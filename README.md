# MyCrossCompile

This project contains a bash script for crosscompilation projects for different hardware stuff with small amout of resources (RAM or(and) CPU) and it's too hard to compile natively.

Before usage, please, edit a .sh script (change here name connected device).
Run script in your bash terminal without super user permissions, but WARNING it can ask you about your system password.
Now use commands 'cmake', 'make' as usually with your Cpp projects.
For exit plese type 'exit'. 
WARNING!!! If you compilation took a lot of time, possibly you should again type a password.
